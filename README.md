- ðŸ‘‹ My name is Casey Macaluso (@caseymacaluso)
- ðŸ‘€ I love writing code (shocking, I know). I have experience writing code in Javascript, Python, R, SQL and Java!
- ðŸŒ± Right now, I'm learning more of the ins and outs of Python! I just finished doing some data analysis and visualization mini-projects,
      and I'm about to jump into machine learning topics, which I already have some familiarity with from my experience with R.
- ðŸ“« macaluso.casey@gmail.com is the best way to reach me if you have any questions about anything.

Thanks for stopping by :)
