- ðŸ‘‹ My name is Casey Macaluso (@caseymacaluso)
- ðŸ‘€ I love writing code (shocking, I know). I have experience writing code in Javascript, Python, R, SQL and Java!
- ðŸ’» Right now I'm learning/re-learning writing code in React. Front end development has always been very interesting to me, so I like to learn about that as much as I can!
- ðŸ“« macaluso.casey@gmail.com is the best way to reach me if you have any questions about anything.

Thanks for stopping by :)
